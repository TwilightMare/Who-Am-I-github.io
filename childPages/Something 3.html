        <p>  Battlefront II Is a game established and Developed by several platforms. It's options range from Multiplayer, to Single Player - 				with a wide variety of worlds to battle on. This comes under the option called "Instant Action." Either Land Battles, or Space 					Battles can be played, including during what time the game would take course during "Star Wars" in General.
        <br><br><br>
       	I find it a fun game to indulge in, with Action and several choices to pick from. I have both versions of the game BattleFront II. There is the slightly older one, and the most recent one, which can be seen in the picture of the header. The newest version does have better graphics, including a developed story-mode which you can play. The slightly older one however, is more focused on fighting in different places, capturing things called "Command Posts" etc.
        <br><br><br>
       	On The Right you can see a video of the original BattleFront II gameplay - which I am actually playing in it.
