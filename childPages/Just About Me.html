NOTES

<p> SOMETHING 5 I'm going to organize this page using divs Sorta - Like a Website Yk </p>


<p> Hiii, My name is Annanya Matharu - my full name however is Annanya Singh Matharu.</p>


<p>My Personality?
- Well in simple terms I can be: Really Stubborn at times ._.
- I over-exert myself on quite a few things trying to make it much better - Cough* This website
- Yes, I continously end up comparing myself to several people
- I can be Goofy and joke around during points in time, but only when I'm comfortable
- I like to spend my time drawing whenever I get some free time, or play a few rounds of my favourite game
- I'm more of an introvert/ambivert - which kind of depends on how I feel
</p>


<p>How Am I Academically?
- I feel I have to put in alot of effort to achieve the marks I do. If I don't put enough effort my grades reflect that.
- I don't think any subject comes naturally to me, to be honest. Before during Elementary and Junior High however, Science usually
came to me quite easily so did French. I actually won a "Science Excellence Award" in Grade 6 when it was time to transition to junior high.
My name is in the school that says I won the award during that year.
--> Now However since I'm in highschool I had to put in more than 4 hours after school, or even 6 hours per day to keep my grades 90%+
- I aim for 95% and more, but during points of time I feel drained, and just don't/can't put the effort I did last semester.

- An example can be: It may take a person an hour or two hours to understand a concept while it would take me three times that time
if I really don't understand it.

Subjects I don't like?
- I feel like it takes me a billion years to understand physics and or math
</p>

<p>Some Sorta Talents I have??
- I edit voices/audios time to time. I can change the quality of the audio, make it deeper, lighter pitched - add reverb etc.
- I am quite a fast typer with speeds of 90wpm - 106wpm
- I'm Really good at Chess - I can understand what moves I have to make against a person, or counter them when the time comes - plus I usually plan ahead
- I'm very very very very unorganized - plus I procrastinate quite a bit at times.
--> Meaning my stuff is all over the place, and while coding this website - I had codes everywhere - and then organized it all very last ._.

- I an animate slightly - but I'm still learning - and it takes a lot of motivation

</p>


<p> Random Stuff I guess
  - I enjoy the night much more than the morning
  - I love the rain, or cloudy cool weathers
  - I try too much for my own good-
  - I have 10 birds
